Creating an RFID tag lock system using Arduino is a practical way to control access to a device or room. Hereâ€™s a basic guide to building an RFID-based lock system. In this setup, an RFID reader will read tags, and an electronic lock (like a solenoid or servo) will be controlled based on the RFID tag data.

Components:
Arduino board
RFID reader (e.g., MFRC522)
RFID tags/cards
Electronic lock (e.g., solenoid lock or servo motor)
Relay module (if using a solenoid lock)
Jumper wires
Wiring:
RFID Reader (MFRC522):

SDA to Pin 10 on Arduino
SCK to Pin 13 on Arduino
MOSI to Pin 11 on Arduino
MISO to Pin 12 on Arduino
RST to Pin 9 on Arduino
3.3V to 3.3V on Arduino
GND to GND on Arduino
Electronic Lock (e.g., Solenoid Lock):

Control Pin to Relay Module input pin (e.g., Pin 8)
Relay Module VCC to 5V on Arduino
Relay Module GND to GND on Arduino
Relay Module NO (Normally Open) to one terminal of the solenoid lock
Relay Module COM (Common) to the power supply terminal of the solenoid lock
Other terminal of the solenoid lock to the power supply (e.g., 12V)

Explanation:
MFRC522 Library: Used for interfacing with the RFID reader.
RFID Reader: Reads the RFID tags/cards.
Relay Module: Controls the electronic lock based on RFID tag validation.
Authorized Tag: Replace "123456789ABC" with the ID of your authorized RFID tag. This ID is typically found in hexadecimal format.
Steps:
Connect the RFID reader and electronic lock according to the wiring instructions.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Place an authorized RFID tag near the reader to unlock the system. Unauthorized tags will be denied access.
Additional Considerations:
Security: You can implement additional security measures like encrypting tag IDs or using a more complex authentication system.
Feedback: Add visual or audible feedback to indicate the lock status (e.g., an LED or buzzer).
This setup allows you to control access using RFID technology effectively.
